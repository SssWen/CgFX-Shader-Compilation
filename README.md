# CgFX-Shader-Compilation

This repo demonstrates several cool CgFX shaders which I'd like to share with you. I have used them in different projects, so I think it's good to keep the most interesting ones in one place:) Everything is made with Unity Engine.

Current list of shaders:
- Interference Shader
- Oren-Nayar Shader
- Simple Snow Shader
- Fast Subsurface Scattering Shader
- Intersection Outline Shader
- See-Through + Rim Shader
- Fur Shader (Shell-Rendering)
- Deformable Surface Tessellation Shader

You can check out the short demonstration video down below:
